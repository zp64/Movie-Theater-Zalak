# Movie-Theater-Zalak

Here we need to calculate ticketPrice base on discount. For that I have made changes in Showing class by calling calculateTicketPrice() function instead ticketPrice().
Wrote logic for *** Any movies showing starting between 11AM ~ 4pm, you'll get 25% discount** and *** Any movies showing on 7th, you'll get 1$ discount**.
Implemented logic for  *** The discount amount applied only one if met multiple rules; biggest amount one**.
Reduced line of code by using "lombok"  library.
Wrote different test cases to check every function.
Created test cases using Spring Junit Testing frameworks which allow developers to wire up their beans via Java classes instead of XML files.
Implemented business logic for print data in JSON format using "Gson" library.
Maintained code quality by following coding standard.
